Exercise: Config File Validator

Objective:
---------
Scan a directory containing .conf files and check that each file contains all required configuration keys.

Requirements:
-------------
1. Input:
    - A directory path containing multiple .conf files.

2. Each .conf file:
    - Contains key=value pairs (one pair per line).
    - May be missing one or more required keys.

3. Required keys:
    - username
    - password
    - host
    - port

4. Script functionality:
    - Loop through all .conf files in the given directory.
    - Parse each file into a dictionary.
    - Identify and report missing keys for each file.

5. Output:
    - For each file missing keys, print:
        File: {filename}
        Missing: {list of missing keys}
    - If a file has all required keys, no output for that file.

Constraints:
------------
- No third-party libraries (e.g., no use of configparser).
- Use only standard libraries (os, argparse, open, etc.).
- Follow clean Python structure with functions.
- Protect execution with if __name__ == "__main__".

Example Output:
---------------
File: db1.conf
Missing: password

File: db2.conf
Missing: username, host

File: db4.conf
Missing: password, port

File: db5.conf
Missing: username, password, host, port
