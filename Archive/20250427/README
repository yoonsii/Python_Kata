Python script that:

    Takes a directory path (where log files are stored).

    For each .log file:

        Check each line's timestamp. Only consider lines from the last 5 minutes.

        Count how many of those lines contain either:

            the word "ERROR"

            or "500" (HTTP 500 errors).

    If a file has more than 10 such errors within the last 5 minutes:

        Create an alert file named {original_filename}_alert.txt

        Alert file text format:
        ALERT: {filename} has {error_count} errors in last 5 minutes.
